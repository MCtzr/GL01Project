# GL01Project

>>Context :

For my 4th semester in the University of Technology of Troyes, I made a 2D Video game in a group of 4 members. This project took us one semester. Here is the file of the final video game.

>>Description :

This has been made on Stencyl, a Video Game creator. We didn't use any programming languages because it's possible to create on stencyl without one. This project was more an organisation one about software projects and not about code implementation.

This game is a 2D RPG of 20min. You are a student stuck inside a big manor. The player will have to get out of this manor, passing through different rooms with some puzzles to resolve.
